The factorial of the integer n, written n!, is defined as:
n!=nx(n-1)x(n-2)x...x3x2x1

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if n=30, we calculate 30x29x28x...x2x1 and get .

Function Description

Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer
Note: Factorials of n>20 can't be stored even in a 64-bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

Input Format
