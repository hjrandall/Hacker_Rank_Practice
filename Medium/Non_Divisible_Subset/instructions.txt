Given a set of distinct integers, print the size of a maximal subset of S where the sum of any 2 numbers in S is not evenly divisible by k.

Example
 s=[19,10,12,10,24,25,22]k=4

One of the arrays that can be created is S[0]=[10,12,25]. Another is S[1]=[19,22,24] . After testing all permutations, the maximum length solution array has 3 elements.

Function Description

Complete the nonDivisibleSubset function in the editor below.

nonDivisibleSubset has the following parameter(s):

int S[n]: an array of integers
int k: the divisor
Returns

int: the length of the longest subset of  meeting the criteria
Input Format

The first line contains 2 space-separated integers, n and k, the number of values in  and the non factor.
The second line contains n space-separated integers, each an S[i], the unique values of the set.

Constraints
1<=n<=10^5
1<=k<=100
1<=S[i]<=10^9

All of the given numbers are distinct.
